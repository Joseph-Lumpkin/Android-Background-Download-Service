A background download service for Android devices.

This application demonstrates the usage of Android and Object Oriented
Programming core concepts and design patterns to create a flexible background
download service.

This service is capable of supporting many more file types. Each of them with
custom handlers for downloading, removing, and providing other helper functions
associated with each or every file type. The download service runs in the
background and listens for broadcasted download requests from other apps that
are designated for this app and contain the download information.
